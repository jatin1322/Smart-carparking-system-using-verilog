Overview- In the entrance of the parking system, there is a sensor which is activated to detect a vehicle coming. Once the sensor is triggered, a password is requested to open the gate. If the entered password is correct, the gate would open to let the vehicle get in. Otherwise, the gate is still locked. If the current car is getting in the car park being detected by the exit sensor and another car comes, the door will be locked and requires the coming car to enter passwords.

Implementation- Moore FSM (output just depends on the current state)


****List of input terminal of state machine****
Name followed by function

1)CLOCK --> CLOCK input to state machine.

2)RESET --> To RESET the whole parking system.

3)Entrance --> To detect the car is entered in the parking lot.

4)Exit  --> To detect the car is passed through the parking system.

5)P1--> Gate is opened to let the car into the parking slot.

6)P2--> If password 1 is incorrect it will check again and let the car into the parking slot

****List of output terminal of state machine****
Name followed by function

1)Yellow LED --> State machine turns to Correct Password state; Yellow light starts blinking.;
To display that car can pass through the parking system.

2) Blue LED  --> Incorrect Password state; If the next car is coming before parking the current car then blue LED will start blinking. : To display the door is closed and vehicle has to stop.

3) Seven Segment Display HEX 1 and HEX2--> To give instructions to the car what needs to be done can be display on screen.

****STATE EXPLANATION****

1) Initial STATE :
Initial is the default state, where Entrance sensor detects. If the sensor is off, the system will not perform any actions. When the entrance sensor detects the car has come, state switched to HOLD.


2) HOLD:
In HOLD state, Blue light will turned ON and display will show ‘Enter Password’. Car user need to type the password to get entry through the parking system. If the password is Incorrect it will go to the Incorrect_Password state and if the password is correct it will go to the Correct_Password state.


3) Correct_Password:
If the password entered correctly in hold state, Green light will show in Correct_Password state and it will display ‘GO’ message indicating that you can enter in the parking system. After crossing the car through the parking system, It will go to the Initial state if there is no other car coming. If another car is coming it will turned on both sensors sensor_entrance==1 && sensor_exit == 1 and so it will go the STOP state.


4) Incorrect_Password:
If the password is Incorrect, Incorrect password state will show Blue light and will display that password is incorrect. It will give driver another chance to enter password and will stay in the same state. If driver enter Correct password after the first failed trial, it will go to the Correct password state, where driver can pass through this system.


5) END:
If another car came after the first car has gone, it will ask to END and enter the password showing Blue light. If then driver entered the Correct password it will go to the Correct state else it will stay in the same state and ask for the pin again.
